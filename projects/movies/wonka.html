The film tells an original story and was developed by King to exist as a "companion piece" to the 1971 film by reprising some of the music, thematic elements, and the visual design of the Oompa Loompas.[7] In May 2021, Chalamet was confirmed to portray Wonka, and the supporting cast was announced in September of that year. Filming began in the United Kingdom in September, at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden, in Watford, as well as Oxford, Lyme Regis, Bath, St Albans, and at the Rivoli Ballroom in Crofton Park, London.[8] The film's original songs were written by Neil Hannon, and its original score by Joby Talbot.

        Rotten Tomatoes found the initial reactions on social media to be mostly positive, with some reviewers criticizing the script and others praising Chalamet's performance and the film's presentation.[94] According to the website, critics found the film to be "silly and fun for the whole family with catchy music and stunning production design, even if it loses some of the edge found in its predecessors."[95] The BBC reported that a number of critics likened the film tonally to the Paddington films, and despite "several glowing reviews", some felt that Wonka "lacks the darker elements of previous versions". Chalamet's performance was both praised and criticized for his singing, while some considered him miscast.[96]

        In a 5 out of 5 star review, Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian wrote that the film is "spectacular, imaginative, sweet-natured and funny". Although Bradshaw appreciated Chalamet's performance, finding it better than previous adaptations of the character, the film does not explain "what happened to him as a young man to turn him into the somewhat ambiguous, even sinister adult figure with a streak of Dahlian cruelty", wondering if in a possible sequel "something happens to sour our young hero".
