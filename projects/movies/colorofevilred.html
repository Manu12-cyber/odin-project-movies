    <h2>Critical Response</h2>

    <p>
        Colors of Evil: Red received mixed reviews from critics. Film critic Johnny Loftus from Decider gave it a mixed review but praised Ostaszewska's performance writing: "Maja Ostaszewska deserves more screen time in Colors of Evil, but she makes the most of what she has, with a ton of mileage earned from a series of ever more drawn looks. The specifics of Helena’s dissolving marriage to Roman go unspoken, but the mistakes they made are written all over Ostaszewska’s features."[2] Narayani M from The New Indian Express gave it a 2 out of 5 stars but also noted Ostaszewska's performance as the victim's mother.[3] Jeffrey Speicher from the Collider also praised Ostaszewska's performance and film overall writing: "Colors of Evil: Red, the one performance that emerges as the most memorable is Maja Ostaszewska as an emotionally broken mother, Helena. From the heart-wrenching moment she has to identify her daughter at the morgue, she is so believable as a horribly traumatized parent going through the inner turmoil of losing her only child."
